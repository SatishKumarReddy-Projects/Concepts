 ### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in the talk is how celebrating small wins can help you build good habits. For example, if you floss just one tooth or do one push-up and then say, “Yes! I did it!” you feel good about yourself. This little celebration makes you want to keep going.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

The formula B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) helps in building habits

* Motivation (M): The reason you want to do the habit. Connect the habit to something you care about or want to achieve to stay motivated.

* Ability (A): How easy the habit is to do. Make the habit simple enough so you can do it with little effort.

* Prompt (P): A reminder to do the habit. Use clear triggers that are linked to something you already do, like a routine.
  
By making sure all three parts work together, forming new habits becomes easier.

### 3. Why it is important to Shine or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 

Celebrating after completing a habit creates a sense of accomplishment, which strengthens the habit. It helps you feel successful, boosting your confidence. This positive reinforcement makes it easier to continue the habit in the future. The more you celebrate small wins, the more motivated you become. Over time, this builds momentum, turning the habit into a natural part of your routine.

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?


The most interesting idea is that small, consistent improvements of 1% can lead to big results. Dave Brailsford used this approach to transform British Cycling into a top team. By making tiny changes in daily habits, you can achieve great success over time. This philosophy applies to any area of life, including personal development. Small improvements compound and create major progress.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book Atomic Habits emphasizes the importance of changing our identity to create lasting change. It explains that instead of focusing on goals, we should focus on becoming the type of person who naturally does the things we want to achieve. For example, if you want to be fit, think of yourself as a healthy person. This mindset will guide your actions and help you build habits that align with your identity. When your habits reflect who you are, lasting transformation happens over time.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier, remove things that make it hard to do. Set up your environment to help you. For example, if you want to exercise, leave your workout clothes ready to go. The easier you make the habit, the more likely you are to do it. Keep things simple and convenient.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To make a habit harder to do, add obstacles or friction that make it more difficult. For example, if you want to stop watching too much TV, unplug the TV or hide the remote. The idea is to create steps that make the bad habit less convenient and harder to perform. This way, you’ll be less likely to fall into the habit.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

Here my habit is playing cricket :

* Leave your cricket gear (bat, ball, or gloves) in a visible spot so you’re reminded to play.

* Invite friends or join a local club for social play, making the game more fun.

* Set up a small practice area at home or nearby so you can easily get started.

* Track your progress, celebrate small achievements like hitting a certain number of runs, or simply enjoy the enjoyment the game brings.

### 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Here my habit is eating junk food :
* Keep junk food out of your home or where you can’t easily see it.

* Think about how junk food harms your health to make it less tempting.

* Make it more difficult to access by not keeping it at home or limiting the places where you can get it easily.

* Link junk food to negative feelings to remind yourself why it’s not worth eating.
