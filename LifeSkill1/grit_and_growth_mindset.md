# Grit and Growth Mindset

###  Grit


The video introduces the concept of grit, which refers to the determination and perseverance to stay committed to long-term goals over an extended period. While it may sound straightforward, this quality is quite uncommon. People with higher levels of grit approach life as a marathon rather than a short sprint.

### Introduction to Growth Mindset

* A growth mindset is the belief that skills and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning, leading to a love for challenges, learning from mistakes, and valuing feedback.
* 
* A fixed mindset, on the other hand, believes abilities are innate and unchangeable, causing people to avoid challenges, fear failure, and ignore feedback because they think it reflects a lack of ability.


### Understanding Internal Locus of Control

Locus of Control is how people see their ability to affect what happens in their lives. It can be either internal or external.

People with an external locus of control believe that things like the weather, their coworkers, or their surroundings control their success or failure. They think their efforts are affected by factors they can't control.

On the other hand, people with an internal locus of control believe their success or failure comes from their own actions and decisions. They feel in charge of their outcomes and believe they can improve with effort. This mindset helps them stay accountable, motivated, and willing to get better.

### How to build a Growth Mindset

* Trust yourself to solve problems and improve, building confidence to face challenges.
* Challenge negative beliefs that restrict growth and recognize your potential to learn and improve over time.
*  Take control of your learning by creating a plan focused on your personal goals and growth.
* Embrace challenges as part of the growth process, seeing them as opportunities for learning and strengthening.
* Learn to bounce back from setbacks, stay focused, and persist in overcoming obstacles on your growth journey.
